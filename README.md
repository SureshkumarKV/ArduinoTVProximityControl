# Arduino TV Proximity Control

My 6 years old son is like a fly, always buzzing around and has this irresitible temptation to go very close to the TV whenerver something really interesting for him is running in it. Despite telling him in all the possible ways I could, this continued to happen.

Last week, I had this wake up call and I decided to solve this problem the engineer's way. So, I made this simple yet very effective Arduino based system that will turn the TV off if my kid goes too close to the TV. Its working as expected since the time and I tought this may be useful for someone else facing same problem. 

Source code (Called sketch in Arduino linguistics) is here  [TVControl2.ino](https://github.com/SureshkumarKV/ArduinoTVProximityControl/blob/master/TVControl2.ino)

Here is the schematic.
